# Service Review System

## Project Overview
The **Service Review System** is a web application that allows users to interact with services by posting reviews. Users can manage services they have added, view other users' reviews, and interact with services. This platform provides full-stack experience, integrating user authentication, CRUD operations for services and reviews, and secure database interactions.

This project is designed as part of the assignment to showcase problem-solving skills and creativity. It involves dynamic routes, JWT authentication, and Firebase integration for login. The project uses modern libraries and frameworks like React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Firebase.
